# Steam Deck Screen Lock
How to Enable Screen Lock on Steam Deck's Desktop Mode

I've been using my Steam Deck as a replacement for my ancient laptop, and while using it at work I noticed that there was no lock screen in Desktop Mode. My usual Win+L keyboard shortcut did nothing. I searched online and found that other people were having the same issue. I looked through all of the system settings, and while I was able to find options regarding locking the screen, nothing seemed to allow me to lock the screen on demand.

Interestingly enough, under System Settings -> Workspace Behavior -> Screen Locking, you can set up a timer to automatically lock the screen, and that appears to work fine. So I knew the functionality had to be on there somewhere.

So I enabled SSH, enabled the automatic lock screen and waited for the Steam Deck to lock itself. Then I ssh'd in and saw the command that was being run:
`/usr/lib/kscreenlocker_greet --immediateLock`

So I made a .desktop file to run the command, and sure enough it seems to work!

## No Virtual keyboard?
Steam's On-Screen Keyboard doesn't show up on top of the lock screen. If your screen is locked, you will need to use a physical keyboard or install [qt5-virtualkeyboard](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/qt5-virtualkeyboard/) - `pacman -S qt5-virtualkeyboard`. This is not the same as Steam's on-screen keyboard.

I'm hoping that Steam eventually releases an update that adds lock screen support for their native keyboard. Until then, this workaround works for me.

## Setup Instructions
Download the screenlock.desktop file (Click on [screenlock.desktop](https://github.com/RHOPKINS13/SteamDeckScreenLock/blob/main/screenlock.desktop) then click the â¬‡ icon). If you execute it, your screen should lock.

If you want to add it to the Start Menu, copy it to `~/.local/share/applications/` (`.local` is a hidden folder! You'll have to [Show Hidden Files in Dolphin](https://tuxexplorer.com/how-do-i-show-hidden-files-on-the-steam-deck) to get there!) Afterwards, it should show up in the Start Menu under Utilities.

If you right-click on it, you can add it to your Favorites for easier access.

Finally, in System Settings you can add a keyboard shortcut to it!

I hope this comes in handy for people!
